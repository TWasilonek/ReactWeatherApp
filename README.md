# React Weather App

This is a simple weather app made with React. 
It's based on the tutorial The Complete App Developer Course by Andrew Mead.

## CORS issues:
I'm using crossorigin.me open source CORS Proxy for requests to the OpenWeather API as it doesn't allow https requests without a paid account. Sometimes crossorigin.me can be down however and modern browsers will block the request which will prevent you from viewing the weather results.

## TODO:
* Styling the app
