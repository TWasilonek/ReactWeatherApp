# React Weather App

This is a simple weather app made with React. 
It's based on the tutorial The Complete App Developer Course by Andrew Mead.



###*This project is still under construction*



## CORS issues:
I'm using crossorigin.me open source CORS Proxy for requests to the OpenWeather API as it doesn't allow https requests without a paid account. Sometimes crossorigin.me can be down however and modern browsers will block the request which will prevent you from viewing the weather results.

## TODO:
* Style the rest of the app
    * Add a weather dashboard with more data about a location
    * Add weather icons
    * Add changing backgrounds
* Move server code to it's own directory and make a cleanup
* Write tests
